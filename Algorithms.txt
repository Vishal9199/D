Give a formal algorithm for path planning with object detection.

Here is a formal algorithm for path planning with object detection:

    Initialize system and establish communication with drone.
    Arm drone and verify all systems functioning properly.
    Take off to desired altitude using appropriate flight mode.
    Begin scanning for target objects using object detection system.
    If target objects detected:
    a. Define region of interest around each target object.
    b. Calculate path to each target object using path planning algorithm.
    c. Send path commands to drone to navigate to each target object.
    d. While drone is in transit:
    i. Continuously monitor drone's behavior and adjust as necessary.
    ii. Detect and avoid obstacles during flight.
    iii. Maintain safe distance from other objects.
    e. Upon reaching each target object:
    i. Hover over target object and perform appropriate task.
    ii. If target object is to be picked up, perform pickup and secure in payload bay.
    iii. If target object is to be dropped off, perform drop off at designated location.
    iv. Remove target object from list of remaining targets.
    If no target objects remaining or new task not initiated:
    a. Return to initial position using path planning algorithm.
    Land drone safely.
    Disarm drone when safe to do so.
    
    
Certainly, here are the more professional versions of the algorithms for each task:

Task 1: Takeoff and Hover

vbnet

1. Initialize the system and establish communication with the drone.
2. Arm the drone and verify that all systems are functioning properly.
3. Take off to the desired altitude using the appropriate flight mode.
4. Enter hover mode and stabilize the drone's position using the appropriate flight controller commands.
5. Maintain altitude and stabilize roll and pitch using the appropriate flight controller commands.
6. Continuously monitor the drone's behavior and adjust as necessary to maintain a stable hover.
7. When the task is complete or a new task is initiated, land the drone safely.
8. Disarm the drone when it is safe to do so.

Task 2: Waypoint Navigation

vbnet

1. Initialize the system and establish communication with the drone.
2. Arm the drone and verify that all systems are functioning properly.
3. Take off to the desired altitude using the appropriate flight mode.
4. Define a set of waypoints for the drone to follow using the appropriate software tools.
5. Engage the waypoint navigation mode and monitor the drone's progress as it follows the predefined flight path.
6. Adjust the drone's flight path as necessary to maintain the desired altitude, heading, and speed.
7. Continuously monitor the drone's behavior and adjust as necessary to maintain a stable flight.
8. When the task is complete or a new task is initiated, land the drone safely.
9. Disarm the drone when it is safe to do so.

Task 3: Object Tracking

vbnet

1. Initialize the system and establish communication with the drone.
2. Arm the drone and verify that all systems are functioning properly.
3. Take off to the desired altitude using the appropriate flight mode.
4. Activate the object tracking system and detect the target object using the appropriate sensors and algorithms.
5. Follow the target object using the appropriate flight controller commands and maintain a safe distance.
6. Continuously monitor the drone's behavior and adjust as necessary to maintain a stable flight.
7. Avoid obstacles and other hazards during flight using the appropriate sensors and algorithms.
8. When the task is complete or a new task is initiated, land the drone safely.
9. Disarm the drone when it is safe to do so.

Task 4: Search and Rescue

vbnet

1. Initialize the system and establish communication with the drone.
2. Arm the drone and verify that all systems are functioning properly.
3. Take off to the desired altitude using the appropriate flight mode.
4. Divide the search area into grids using the appropriate algorithms.
5. Scan each grid using the camera or other sensors to locate the target object or person.
6. When the target is located, hover over it and drop a payload (such as a first aid kit) using the appropriate flight controller commands.
7. Continuously monitor the drone's behavior and adjust as necessary to maintain a stable flight.
8. Return to the search area and continue searching until the mission is complete or a new task is initiated.
9. When the task is complete or a new task is initiated, land the drone safely.
10. Disarm the drone when it is safe to do so.

Task 5: Automated Landing

vbnet

1. Initialize the system and establish communication with the drone.
2. Arm the drone and verify that all systems are functioning properly.
3. Take off to the desired altitude using the appropriate flight mode.
4. Begin the automated landing sequence and monitor the drone's descent using the appropriate flight controller commands.
5. Detect and avoid obstacles during descent using the appropriate sensors and algorithms.
6. Stabilize the drone just above the ground using the appropriate flight
